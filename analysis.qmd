## Data Analysis

This data analysis on the Household Pulse Survey focuses on understanding the relationships between mental health, mental well being, and various socioeconomic and demographic factors. Data from the Health Resources and Services Administration are incorporated to provide insights into mental health providers across states. The key questions that are being addressed are:

1. How do measures of mental well-being (e.g. levels of worry, anxiety and other mental health indicators) change according to age, income, education, race?
2. How does access to mental health services vary based on income level, educational attainment and race/ethnicity?

#### Findings
The analysis reveals that mental health varies significantly across demographic and socioeconomic factors. Younger adults report higher levels of mental health challenges, with scores improving as age increases. Income has a non-linear relationship, with mental health peaking at mid-range income levels, while higher education correlates weakly with mental health concerns.

There are also significant geographic disparities in mental health provider availability, with Northeastern states having higher concentrations of providers than Southern states. However, increased provider availability primarily benefits higher-income populations, which emphasizes the need for policies addressing accessibility and affordability to improve mental health outcomes across all income levels.

## I. Frequency of Mental Health Symptoms
The Household Pulse Survey collects data on how frequently respondents experience various mental health symptoms, including anxiety, worry, disinterest, and depression. For each symptom, respondents choose from four possible values: `1` (Not at all), `2` (Several days), `3` (More than half the days), and `4` (Nearly every day). These individual responses are then summed to create a mental health score, with a lower score indicating less frequent experience of mental health symptoms.

### Basic Analysis
```{r}
mh_frequency <- read_rds("dataset/pulse_data.rds") |>
  mutate(total_mentalhealth = Anxious_Frequency + Worry_Frequency + 
         Little_Interest_Frequency + Depressed_Frequency) |>
  filter(!is.na(Anxious_Frequency), Anxious_Frequency != 0,
         !is.na(Worry_Frequency), Worry_Frequency != 0,
         !is.na(Little_Interest_Frequency), Little_Interest_Frequency != 0,
         !is.na(Depressed_Frequency), Depressed_Frequency != 0)

# Calculate total mental health 
mh_frequency <- mh_frequency |>
  mutate(age_group = cut(2024 - Birth_Year, 
                        breaks = c(0, 25, 35, 45, 55, Inf),
                        labels = c("18-24", "25-34", "35-44", "45-54", "55+")))

```
When examining mental health trends across demographics, younger adults (18-24) report higher levels of mental health challenges compared to older age groups, with mental health scores gradually improving as age increases. This may be due to life transitions, academic or career pressures, and the impact of social media, while older individuals may experience more stability in their personal and professional lives, leading to better mental health.

However, older adults may also be less likely to admit mental health struggles due to historically stronger stigmas surrounding mental health. [Research](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2875324/pdf/nihms181113.pdf) on the impact of stigma and race in older individuals with depression found that perceived public stigma among older adults is fairly high. In addition, it is also important to note that the age category of 18-24 has the least amount of data, and there is no data for individuals under the age of 18.

The relationship between income and mental health changes: individuals with lower income initially report better mental health, but the mental health score peaks in the lower mid-range incomes. Education levels show a relatively stable relationship with mental health, with a slight downward trend as individuals attain higher levels of education, likely due to cumulative stress and life challenges over time.

These findings highlight the need for further investigation into how age and income intersect with mental health.

### Linear Regression Model
```{r}
source("scripts/analysis_prepare_data.R")
source("scripts/analysis_create_plots.R")

analyze_mental_health_faceted <- function(data) {
  prepared_data <- prepare_data(data)
  plots <- create_plots(data, prepared_data)
  plots$line_plot / plots$qq_plot
}

analyze_mental_health_faceted(mh_frequency)
```
Before performing linear regression, the data is prepared via the [prepare_data function](/scripts/analysis_prepare_data.R). This function processes mental health survey data by calculating the average frequencies of anxiety, worry, loss of interest, and depression across age, income, and education level. Then it restructures the data into a long format, where each row represents a specific mental health metric for a particular demographic value.

After the data is prepared for linear regression, the plots are created using the [create_plot function](/scripts/analysis_create_plot.R). This creates a line plot showing the relationships between mental health metrics and demographic variables (age, income, and education), and Q-Q plots for each relationship.

### Linear Regression Analysis
Based on these plots, the demographic variables have the following relationship with the mental health indicators:

 - **Age**: This demographic variable has the strongest relationship among the mental health indicators. Young adults (around age 20) report the highest levels of mental health concerns, with scores around 1.75-2.0, while older adults (80+) report much lower levels, around 1.25.
 - **Education**: There is a moderate negative relationship with mental health issues. As educational attainment increases, reported mental health concerns decrease gradually. However, the slope is less steep than with age, suggesting a weaker effect.
 - **Income**: Higher incomes are associated with slightly lower mental health concerns.
 
Across all three plots, anxiety constantly demonstrates the highest reported frequency across age, education, and income levels.

Looking at the Q-Q plots, the residuals for all three demographic variables show reasonable normality in the middle ranges, but have some deviations at the tails. Out of the three demographics, age has the most consistent normality across the distribution, suggesting that age is the most reliable predictor of mental health outcomes in this dataset.

The summary statistics for the linear regressions show that older age, higher income, and greater education are all significantly associated with better mental health. However, there is a lot of variance. Age has the strongest effect, with mental health scores decreasing by 0.0117 points per year (p < 0.001), followed by income (-0.0564 per category, p < 2.99e-316), and education (-0.0547 per level, p < 5.76e-148). This aligns with the initial findings in the basic analysis.

  )

  )
```
The Area Health Resource Data gives insights into access to mental health services across the United States. The map of providers per 100k by state reveals significant geographic disparities in mental health provider distribution across the United States, with notably higher provider concentrations in northeastern states and lower concentrations in southern states.

Economic and educational differences between regions may play a role in these findings - Northeastern states tend to have higher average incomes, more prestigious universities and teaching hospitals, which helps attract and retain mental health professionals. These states often offer better salaries and career opportunities for providers compared to southern states.

In addition, culture and policy differences surrounding mental health may affect variation in the number of mental health providers. Northeastern states historically have had more progressive policies around mental healthcare access and less stigma around seeking mental health treatment. For example, Vermont was one of the first states to require insurance companies to cover mental health treatment the same as physical health. In contrast, some southern states have traditionally had more conservative approaches to mental health funding and services.

Linear regression was performed on the number of psychologists, social workers and counselors in total in the United States, and shows that there is a weak negative correlation between provider availability and mental health scores across all three provider types, suggesting that areas with more providers tend to have slightly better mental health outcomes (lower scores).

Psychologists have the strongest relationship with mental health outcomes, with a statistically significant effect (p < 0.02). However, social workers and counselors do not have a statistically significant relationship with mental health outcomes. The Q-Q plots show that the data has a lot of outliers and is heavy-tailed.

The map of healthcare providers across states combined with the findings of the linear regression model suggest that while provider availability affects mental health outcomes, other socioeconomic and demographic factors have more substantial impacts. In addition, increasing provider numbers may not be sufficient to dramatically improve population mental health outcomes without addressing other contributing factors.

### Investigating Income and Psychologist Availability
```{r}
# Prepare the data and run statistical tests

    psychologists_per_100k = psychol_21 / (popn_pums_21/100000),

```
The previous section revealed that while provider availability, more specifically psychologists, can affect mental health outcomes, there may be other socioeconomic factors that have more substantial impact. The investigation into the relationship between income and psychologists suggests:

 1. **High Income**: This population has the only statistically relationship (p < 0.03) with psychologist availability, suggesting that higher income individuals benefit the most from psychologist availability

 2. **Middle/Low Income**: Neither low-income (p ≈ 0.94) nor middle-income (p ≈ 0.58) groups show statistically significant relationships between psychologist availability and mental health outcomes. The middle-income population has a slope of -0.000116 and the low-income has a slope -0.000022, which is the flattest slope of the group.

The data suggests that merely increasing the number of psychologists in an area will only significantly benefit the high-income populations. This population tends to have fewer barriers to accessing care (flexible work schedules, transportation, etc.). This analysis highlights the need for more comprehensive approaches to mental healthcare that address not just provider availability, but also affordability, accessibility, and other socioeconomic barriers that may prevent lower-income populations from benefiting from increased mental health resources.

These findings are also supported by a [study](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8214217/pdf/main.pdf) conducted in 2021 about barriers to healthcare access among U.S. adults with mental health challenges, which found that those worried about affording normal healthcare had 1.60 times higher odds of no usual source of care.

## Flaws and Limitations

This analysis has several important limitations that should be considered when interpreting the results and planning future research.

The Household Pulse Survey relies on self-reported mental health symptoms, which may be subject to reporting bias, especially given cultural differences in willingness to discuss mental health. Survey responses might also be affected by temporary circumstances rather than accurately reflecting long-term mental health status. In addition, the Area Health Resource Data does not provide any information about the number of providers for each type mental health provider that accept insurance, and only has information for the provider counts up to 2021.

The geographic analysis at the state level is helpful to look at the bigger picture across the United States. However, this analysis fails to capture the difference between urban and rural disparities within states, and local variation in provider availability. When considering household income, the study does not fully account for the cost of living differences between regions and other determinants of health like housing stability and food security.
