    "section": "Overview of Household Pulse Survey Data",
    "text": "Overview of Household Pulse Survey Data\nThis data comes from a partnership between the Census Bureau, the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), and other federal agencies. The Household Pulse Survey is a 20-minute online survey published every two weeks, starting on April 23, 2020. The analyzed data set comes from the survey period between August 20 and September 16, 2024, and is available on the Census Bureau website.\n\nPurpose and Design of the Survey\nThe survey was developed to provide timely and relevant data on the impact of COVID-19 in the United States. While multiple federal agencies contributed to the effort, the Census Bureau led the data collection.\nThe Household Pulse Survey was specifically designed to collect data representing social and economic issues affecting American households. This data is critical for informing state and federal decisions, particularly during the peak of the pandemic when emergency response efforts were most urgent. Unlike other surveys tracking similar data, the Household Pulse Survey stands out for its frequent data collection and quicker turnaround.\n\n\nResearch and Insights\nThere have been various research efforts aimed to improve survey effectiveness and understand respondent behavior. For example:\n\nSurvey Response Strategies: Renee Reeves and Kayla Varela conducted research to evaluate the Household Pulse Survey experiments. They analyzed strategies that increased response rates, focusing on contact methods such as text vs. email and URL length. Their findings include:\n\nText messages yielded higher response rates compared to emails.\n\nShorter URLs containing “census.gov” were more effective than longer URLs.\n\nSending texts exclusively, rather than a combination of texts and emails, generated the best responses.\n\nDemographic Analysis: Other research has explored demographics of respondents and nonrespondents, particularly those who selected non-definitive response categories. Studies also examined which demographics were more likely to answer questions related to sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI).\n\n\n\nPotential Issues and Biases\nThe Household Pulse Survey has several limitations that could impact the data’s accuracy and representativeness:\n\nVoluntary and Self-Reported Date: Responses are voluntary and self-reported, potentially leading to inconsistencies in how respondents interpret scales and questions, particularly on sensitive topics like mental health, where stigmas are present. Additionally, some respondents skip questions, which limits the data’s completeness.\nNon-Participation Bias: While participants are randomly selected, those who choose not to participate may differ systematically from respondents. For example, nonparticipants may distrust the government or lack time to fill out the survey, which could correlate with survey variables.\nExclusion of Certain Populations: The survey relies on household addresses, excluding individuals experiencing homelessness, which is an important demographic when considering the impact of COVID-19.\nChanges in Question Design: Survey questions have evolved over time, potentially impacting comparability. For instance, mental health questions initially asked about symptoms over a 7-day period but later shifted to a 14-day period in Phase 3.2. This change could lead to different responses, as a longer timeframe may capture more variation in experiences."

    "text": "Data Files and Variables\nThe Household Pulse Survey dataset includes a broad range of variables, from veteran status to the impacts of natural disasters. To streamline the analysis and focus on specific areas of interest, we narrowed the scope to the following categories and variables. Variables with significant missing data, such as school type, were excluded.\n\nBasic Descriptive Variables: Birth Year, Hispanic vs. Non-Hispanic, Race, Marital Status, Gender at Birth, Gender Identity, Sexuality, State, Household Income\nEducation and Employment: Education Level, Employment Status, Job Loss, Kind of Work, Reason Not Working\nActive Duty and Veteran Status: Active Duty, Veteran\nMental Health: Anxiousness, Worry, Interest (or lack thereof), Feeling Down, Children’s Mental Health Treatment (Need for treatment, Receiving treatment, Difficulty obtaining treatment, Satisfaction with treatment), Social Support, Loneliness, Public vs. Private Health Care\n\n\nOverview of Area Health Resource Data\nWe also compared the Household Pulse Survey to the Area Health Resource Data for 2022-2023 at the State and National Level from the Health Resources & Services Administration (HRSA). The Area Health Resources Files (AHRF) dataset has over 6,000 variables with current and historical data at county, state, and national levels, covering health care professions, facilities, population characteristics, economics, and more. It is designed for planners, policymakers, and researchers, and includes geographic codes for linking with other datasets and aggregating data by region.\nThere a fewer worries of bias within this data as the numbers are not self reported. Additionally, professionals such as psychologists and social workers must be licensed in their state to practice, meaning the government has access to accurate numbers of professionals in each state. However, the simple numbers of professionals does not provide a full story of access to mental health care in a state. For example, there are questions about how many are private versus work for state institutions, what proportion work in crisis care and how many take different types of insurances. Therefore, these numbers are a good starting point to see access to care across different states, but can not give the full story.\nWe looked at the number of psychologists, social workers, counselors per state using this dataset."

    "text": "Data Analysis\nThis data analysis on the Household Pulse Survey focuses on understanding the relationships between mental health, mental well being, and various socioeconomic and demographic factors. Data from the Health Resources and Services Administration are incorporated to provide insights into mental health providers across states. The key questions that are being addressed are:\n\nHow do measures of mental well-being (e.g. levels of worry, anxiety and other mental health indicators) change according to age, income, education, race?\nHow does access to mental health services vary based on income level, educational attainment and race/ethnicity?\n\n\nFindings\nThe analysis reveals that mental health varies significantly across demographic and socioeconomic factors. Younger adults report higher levels of mental health challenges, with scores improving as age increases. Income has a non-linear relationship, with mental health peaking at mid-range income levels, while higher education correlates weakly with mental health concerns.\nThere are also significant geographic disparities in mental health provider availability, with Northeastern states having higher concentrations of providers than Southern states. However, increased provider availability primarily benefits higher-income populations, which emphasizes the need for policies addressing accessibility and affordability to improve mental health outcomes across all income levels."

    "section": "I. Frequency of Mental Health Symptoms",
    "text": "I. Frequency of Mental Health Symptoms\nThe Household Pulse Survey collects data on how frequently respondents experience various mental health symptoms, including anxiety, worry, disinterest, and depression. For each symptom, respondents choose from four possible values: 1 (Not at all), 2 (Several days), 3 (More than half the days), and 4 (Nearly every day). These individual responses are then summed to create a mental health score, with a lower score indicating less frequent experience of mental health symptoms.\n\nBasic Analysis\nWhen examining mental health trends across demographics, younger adults (18-24) report higher levels of mental health challenges compared to older age groups, with mental health scores gradually improving as age increases. This may be due to life transitions, academic or career pressures, and the impact of social media, while older individuals may experience more stability in their personal and professional lives, leading to better mental health. However, older adults may also be less likely to admit mental health struggles due to historically stronger stigmas surrounding mental health. It is also important to note that the age category of 18-24 has the least amount of data\nThe relationship between income and mental health changes: individuals with lower income initially report better mental health, but the mental health score peaks in the lower mid-range incomes. Education levels show a relatively stable relationship with mental health, with a slight downward trend as individuals attain higher levels of education, likely due to cumulative stress and life challenges over time.\nThese findings highlight the need for further investigation into how age and income intersect with mental health.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinear Regression Model\nBefore performing linear regression, the data is prepared via the prepare_data function. This function processes mental health survey data by calculating the average frequencies of anxiety, worry, loss of interest, and depression across age, income, and education level. Then it restructures the data into a long format, where each row represents a specific mental health metric for a particular demographic value.\nAfter the data is prepared for linear regression, the plots are created using the create_plot function. This creates a line plot showing the relationships between mental health metrics and demographic variables (age, income, and education), and Q-Q plots for each relationship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinear Regression Analysis\nBased on these plots, the demographic variables have the following relationship with the mental health indicators:\n\nAge: This demographic variable has the strongest relationship among the mental health indicators. Young adults (around age 20) report the highest levels of mental health concerns, with scores around 1.75-2.0, while older adults (80+) report much lower levels, around 1.25.\nEducation: There is a moderate negative relationship with mental health issues. As educational attainment increases, reported mental health concerns decrease gradually. However, the slope is less steep than with age, suggesting a weaker effect.\nIncome: Higher incomes are associated with slightly lower mental health concerns.\n\nAcross all three plots, anxiety constantly demonstrates the highest reported frequency across age, education, and income levels.\nLooking at the Q-Q plots, the residuals for all three demographic variables show reasonable normality in the middle ranges, but have some deviations at the tails. Out of the three demographics, age has the most consistent normality across the distribution, suggesting that age is the most reliable predictor of mental health outcomes in this dataset.\nThe summary statistics for the linear regressions show that older age, higher income, and greater education are all significantly associated with better mental health. However, there is a lot of variance. Age has the strongest effect, with mental health scores decreasing by 0.0117 points per year (p &lt; 0.001), followed by income (-0.0564 per category, p &lt; 2.99e-316), and education (-0.0547 per level, p &lt; 5.76e-148). This aligns with the initial findings in the basic analysis."

    "text": "II. Access to Mental Health Services\n\nBasic Analysis\nThe Area Health Resource Data gives insights into access to mental health services across the United States. The map of providers per 100k by state reveals significant geographic disparities in mental health provider distribution across the United States, with notably higher provider concentrations in northeastern states and lower concentrations in southern states.\nEconomic and educational differences between regions may play a role in these findings - Northeastern states tend to have higher average incomes, more prestigious universities and teaching hospitals, which helps attract and retain mental health professionals. These states often offer better salaries and career opportunities for providers compared to southern states.\nIn addition, culture and policy differences surrounding mental health may affect variation in the number of mental health providers. Northeastern states historically have had more progressive policies around mental healthcare access and less stigma around seeking mental health treatment. For example, Vermont was one of the first states to require insurance companies to cover mental health treatment the same as physical health. In contrast, some southern states have traditionally had more conservative approaches to mental health funding and services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinear Regression Analysis\nLinear regression was performed on the number of psychologists, social workers and counselors in total in the United States, and shows that there is a weak negative correlation between provider availability and mental health scores across all three provider types, suggesting that areas with more providers tend to have slightly better mental health outcomes (lower scores).\nPsychologists have the strongest relationship with mental health outcomes, with a statistically significant effect (p &lt; 0.02). However, social workers and counselors do not have a statistically significant relationship with mental health outcomes. The Q-Q plots show that the data has a lot of outliers and is heavy-tailed.\nThe map of healthcare providers across states combined with the findings of the linear regression model suggest that while provider availability affects mental health outcomes, other socioeconomic and demographic factors have more substantial impacts. In addition, increasing provider numbers may not be sufficient to dramatically improve population mental health outcomes without addressing other contributing factors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestigating Income and Psychologist Availability\nThe previous section revealed that while provider availability, more specifically psychologists, can affect mental health outcomes, there may be other socioeconomic factors that have more substantial impact. The investigation into the relationship between income and psychologists suggests:\n\nHigh Income: This population has the only statistically relationship (p &lt; 0.03) with psychologist availability, suggesting that higher income individuals benefit the most from psychologist availability.\nMiddle/Low Income: Neither low-income (p ≈ 0.94) nor middle-income (p ≈ 0.58) groups show statistically significant relationships between psychologist availability and mental health outcomes. The middle-income population has a slope of -0.000116 and the low-income has a slope -0.000022, which is the flattest slope of the group.\n\nThe data suggests that merely increasing the number of psychologists in an area will only significantly benefit the high-income populations. This population tends to have fewer barriers to accessing care (flexible work schedules, transportation, etc.). This analysis highlights the need for more comprehensive approaches to mental healthcare that address not just provider availability, but also affordability, accessibility, and other socioeconomic barriers that may prevent lower-income populations from benefiting from increased mental health resources."

    "section": "Flaws and Limitations",
    "text": "Flaws and Limitations\nThis analysis has several important limitations that should be considered when interpreting the results and planning future research.\nThe Household Pulse Survey relies on self-reported mental health symptoms, which may be subject to reporting bias, especially given cultural differences in willingness to discuss mental health. Survey responses might also be affected by temporary circumstances rather than accurately reflecting long-term mental health status. In addition, the Area Health Resource Data does not provide any information about the number of providers for each type mental health provider that accept insurance, and only has information for the provider counts up to 2021.\nThe geographic analysis at the state level is helpful to look at the bigger picture across the United States. However, this analysis fails to capture the difference between urban and rural disparities within states, and local variation in provider availability. When considering household income, the study does not fully account for the cost of living differences between regions and other determinants of health like housing stability and food security."

    "text": "This week, we finished merging our two datasets. We had some initial issues because we had to make adjustments to our primary dataset by assigning new values to a column. The column “EST_ST,” representing the state that the participants live in, had values 1-50 to reflect each state. However, the dataset that we are merging (healthcare accessibility data) had the states written out to reflect where participants lived, so we had to convert values (Alabama = 1, Alaska = 2, …). Once this was changed, we were able to merge the data and perform initial analyses.\nWe spent the majority of this week fixing the errors in the merging of our data. Our goal for the coming week is to continue working on analyses of the combined data. Eventually, our plan is to create a series of maps to compare states.\nWe created some plots to explore what the relationship between our variables that are new to the data: psychol_21 (number of psychologists in the state), socwk_21 (number of social workers in the state), conslrs_21 (number of counselors in the state). We faceted 3 plots where these were the x values and the y were the average mental health values grouped by state. The results are below:\n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt seems that there is a slight increase of mental health values as the number of specialists increase. These findings are important because they show that a higher number of specialists benefits the mental health of the state population, although the increase is not very high. We will continue to work with this data in order to find more insight between the number of specialists and the variables of importance in our original dataset."

    "text": "We looked into various datasets that could be joined with ours, allowing a more in-depth analysis. Some of our ideas included joining datasets concerning COVID-19, healthcare accessibility, unemployment rates, and weather, all joined on either date or region. The COVID-19 dataset could account for any anomalies within our data during the pandemic’s peak, specifically recognizing changes in unemployment status and income, which may have impacted mental health. Healthcare accessibility could influence mental health, as proximity to care facilities affects the frequency of seeing medical providers. Unemployment rates by region could illustrate which places have the highest and lowest unemployment rates, and from there, we could compare which groups of people are most likely to reside in certain regions and whether their demographics impact or are impacted by other variables. Lastly, weather data could find correlations between time of year and poor mental health, potentially showing the effects of seasonal depression. By accounting for these outside variables (the COVID-19 pandemic, accessibility to healthcare facilities, unemployment status by location, and seasonal depression), we could train our model better to recognize these influences.\nWe ultimately chose to assess healthcare accessibility data, specifically the 2022-2023 State and National Level Data. One challenge with this dataset is that it has 6000 variables, but we have selected to examine specific access to providers, like social workers, primary care, psychologists, child psychiatrists, and a few others. We are merging this data on “state” to determine how healthcare accessibility varies by region and impacts mental health. We have not yet finished combining the dataset, so we do not have any preliminary analyses. Our next step is to clean the data, and from there, we can determine any initial findings.\n\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_bin()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbove are a few histograms that outline the distribution of the proportion of # of each type of specialist per person. The distributions seem to be very similar, with high counts near the left side of the range, and a right-skewed shape. This shows us that many of the proportions of specialists in each state does not seem to vary much, however there are some states with proportions of specialists that are much higher than others. We will continue to analyze this data to see if there are connections that we can create between healthcare accessibility and the other mental health statistics."

    "text": "Cardiovascular Disease Mortality | Dataset\nThis dataset provided by the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services contains county-level estimates of hypertension-related cardiovascular disease (CVD) from 2000 to 2019, as well as two 10-year trends (2000-2010, 2010-2019), by age group, race/ethnicity, and sex. Each year and 10-year period contains 50,176 rows. About half of the values for “Data_Value” are na (empty), possibly because some demographics are not represented in state populations.\nWe may be more interested in looking at individual years, as 1. the total dataset amounts to over 1 million rows, and 2. the rows concerning 10-year trends are calculated through a Bayesian model and do not represent raw data."

    "text": "Household Pulse Survey | Dataset\nThe Household Pulse Survey surveys households across the country on a variety of different measures of wellbeing including mental health, food access, and housing. This survey has been collected since 2020 and is collected using a two weeks on, two weeks off approach. This means that there are several data sets spanning the past four years. Looking at one survey period, there are 51281 rows and 163 columns.\nThe data is collected to get quick information on the social and economic wellbeing of households across the country. Looking at this data we could examine changes in mental health across different states and over the past four years. We could also look at different economic factors for example housing and food insecurity across time and regions. There are several potential challenges with this data set. First, since this survey is distributed so frequently, there are close to 60 data sets per year which may be difficult to sift through. Additionally, as the data looks at a wide range of factors it may be difficult to focus on one or two."

    "text": "Drug Overdose Death Rates | Dataset\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention documented drug overdose death rates based on drug type, sex, age, race, and Hispanic origin. The dataset dates from 1999 to 2018, with 6228 rows and 16 columns. The CDC has released datasets containing this information annually since 1999 and has data up to 2019, but isn’t publicly available on their website.\nWe are hoping to analyze the disparities in drug overdoses based on race from the 20 years of data collection. From the data, we could also determine which races have the highest access (potentially finding what race the majority of the youngest age, documented as “Under 15 years,” drug overdoses occur) to certain drugs e.g. heroin and natural and semisynthetic opioids, and the death rates associated with each drug. The time progression can show trends in access to drugs and deaths, although a possible challenge is that we might see rising numbers in deaths solely as a byproduct of the growing population. This might mean we need to standardize the data with respect to population count. Another concern is there are 11 values in the “STUB_LABEL” column, so we may need to group columns to visualize the effects of race on drug overdose better."

    "text": "These are the steps that you will take today to get started on your project. Today, you will just be brainstorming, and then next week, you’ll get started on the main aspects of the project.\n\nStart by introducing yourselves to each other. I also recommend creating a private channel on Microsoft Teams with all your team members. This will be a place that you can communicate and share ideas, code, problems, etc.\nDiscuss what aspects of the project each of you are more or less excited about. These include\n\nCollecting, cleaning, and munging data ,\nStatistical Modeling,\nVisualization,\nWriting about analyses, and\nManaging and reviewing team work.\n\nBased on this, discuss where you feel your strengths and weaknesses might be.\nNext, start brainstorming questions you hope to answer as part of this project. This question should in some way be addressing issues around racial disparities. The questions you come up with should be at the level of the question we started with when exploring the HMDA data. (“Are there differences in the ease of securing a loan based on the race of the applicant?”) You’ll revise your questions a lot over the course of the project. Come up with a few questions that your group might be interested in exploring.\nBased on these questions, start looking around for data that might help you analyze this. If you are looking at U.S. based data, data.gov is a good source and if you are looking internationally, I recommend checking out the World Bank. Also, try Googling for data. Include “data set” or “dataset” in your query. You might even include “CSV” or some other format. Using “data” by itself in your query often doesn’t work too well. Spend some time searching for data and try to come up with at least three possible data sets. (For your first blog post, you’ll write short proposals about each of them that I’ll give feedback on.)\nCome up with a team name. Next week, I’ll provide the Github Classroom assignment that will be where you work on your final project and you’ll have to have your team name finalized by then. Your project will be hosted online at the website with a URL like sussmanbu.github.io/ma4615-fa23-final-project-TEAMNAME.\n\nNext time, you’ll get your final project website set up and write your first blog post."

We are also mindful that there are potential biases from this dataset and other research has shown how certain question orderings impact responses.

    "text": "Data for Equity\n\nBeneficence:\nOne of the principles for advancing equitable data practice is to “be transparent about the limits of the data”. This is relevant to our data because the data from the Household Pulse Survey is voluntary and self-reported, possibly leading to different interpretations for each question, especially ones regarding mental health. This principle entails adding disclaimers to the data analysis. Without transparency, the analysis could be misinterpreted and abused.\n\n\nJustice\nAnother principle is to “return data and research results to community members in a form they can use”. This is important so members who were surveyed for the Household Pulse Survey can benefit and learn from the data collection. We will do this for our data by presenting the analysis in an accessible and organized format on the group project website."

    "text": "During this week, we continued to clean and explore the Household Pulse Survey data that we chose. Within the cleaning procedure, we have removed all columns that do not align with what we want to focus on, which is mental health. We reduced the column size from about 220 to 43, making the data much more manageable for our data processing. Furthermore, we have modified the source’s null values, which were -88, into NULL values to change the data into a form that we are comfortable with.\nNow that we have cleaned our data, we are also able to do some exploratory data analysis to see some initial trends and potential biases within our data. Our data cleaning and exploration can be found in the data segment of the project, but below is one of our most interesting graphs:\n\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a graph that shows the distribution of a participant’s birth year, and while also showing the difficulty of finding mental health treatment for their children. The first thing to notice is that most of the birth years are centralized between 1970 - 1990, and this is probably because most of the people who are considered parents within the survey were born between 1970-1990. The colors that represent the difficulty of finding mental health shows high counts of 1 and 2, implying that it is not very difficult to find mental health resources for children. We plan on working on analyzing mental health data, so these preliminary graphs can help us understand some things about the data that are not visible from just looking at the table."

    "text": "Since our last blog post, we have fully incorporated our second dataset about specialist counts into our analysis, and have begun to use it to aid our narratives surrounding the thesis. Although not finalized, our thesis states that several factors impact mental well-being, including access to mental health care, age, income, education, and race. To prove our thesis, we have created several visuals and models that help visualize our points. Many of these visuals are on our analysis page, but here are a few that highlight our work thus far:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we can see with the line plots, the average mental health score decreases as our values of age, education, and income increase - indicating that there is a negative relationship between the average mental health score and those factors. Since a higher mental health score indicates a higher frequency of feeling anxiety, depression, interest, or worry, based on the plots, it is suggested that people with higher ages, education levels, and household incomes tend to have higher mental well-being than others.\nAnother form of visuals that we have created is maps. These maps can help us understand relationships between the factors that we are comparing to mental health. The maps show the values of certain variables that we wanted to explore, including mean_income of the state, mean_edu (mean education level of the state), mean_total_mh the mean mental health values of the state, and psychol, the number of psychologists in the state. Each of these maps is beneficial because they summarize our data in a much easier way to interpret than bar graphs or pie charts. We plan to continue advancing our maps to contain more information like titles, labels, etc.\nBy comparing the maps, we can see similarities within the data and can begin to draw conclusions - it seems that the south and midwest regions of the USA have lower values in each of the categories, including mean_total_mh, suggesting that all these variables could be correlated to each other.\nThese two forms of visuals are strong examples of visuals that we plan to use for our project. They are both easy to understand and highlight important findings from the data that aid our thesis."

    "text": "During this week, we have further cleaned the data to prepare it for modeling and analysis. Some of the changes we have made to the data are to make the data more comprehensive without a data dictionary. For example, the column ACTVDUTY1 represents whether one or one’s spouse currently is not active in the U.S. Armed Forces. We changed the column name to Not_Currently_Serving_in_US_Armed_Forces. We have also changed the row data since our row data was just numbers that represented values. For example, for the row RHISPANIC, which has been renamed to Hispanic, the values within the column is either 1 or 2, based on whether the person is hispanic or not. We have changed it to Yes or No to help us understand the data more efficiently.\nOther than cleaning, we have begun putting effort into modeling and analysis. We have created a new column that aggregates the values within the mental health columns such as anxiety, worry, feeling down, and interest. This will help us understand the effect of certain variables on mental health overall. With this new column, we were able to compare it to household income using the lm() function in R. The results of our model are interesting, and some of our results can be seen below with our Normal QQ plot:\n\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot shows that our distribution of residuals are not normally distributed. Within the middle quantiles, the residuals follow the normal distribution, but the farther quantiles from the mean show a difference from the normal distribution. These differences imply that within the farther quantiles, the data says very similar in their residuals, signaling that there may be some sort of boundaries in our data that the data cannot exceed."

are all of the different factors and how they change across states. The maps show that income and education appear to be correlated at the state level, as many states with higher average incomes also have higher average levels of education. Additionally, areas with higher average incomes and levels of education appear to also have improved access to care. However, the maps show no clear correlation with mental well-being.\nFor instance, New York has a high mean income, educational attainment, and psychology count, reaffirming two of our beliefs: states with higher average incomes tend to have higher average levels of educational attainment (1), and states with high averages income and educations levels tend to have better access to psychologists (2). New York’s level of mental health concern is also on the lower end of the scale. With this said, we can not definitively state that there is a correlation between those three factors and mental well-being. Let us look at Utah, for example. Utah has relatively high averages in income, educational attainment, and psychologist count compared to other states. However, they have high mental health concerns compared to other states. In a similar manner, South Carolina has low averages in income, educational attainment, and psychologist count, yet have low mental health concerns when compared to other states with low means in income, educational levels, and psychologist count. Given these three state examples, we can see there are correlations between average income, educational attainment, and psychologist count, but we can not certainly establish any trends with mental well-being.\nWe will see if these correlations continue throughout our analysis.\nThe coord_sf element was found using Stack Overflow\nList of 136\n $ line                            : list()\n  ..-

Following our analysis from the maps, there appears to be a positive correlation between both income and education level and access to mental health. This means higher income and education levels in a state correspond with higher numbers of psychologists.\nHowever, this data is also limited as it only looks on the state level not a small scale such as by city or county which may have more variation in number of psychologists, income, and education level.\nggplot(joint_data) +\n  geom_point(aes(x=mean_income, y = psychol), alpha = 0.01) +\n  geom_smooth(aes(x=mean_income, y = psychol), method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) +\n  theme (legend.position = \"none\") +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Household Income\",\n    y = \"Psychologists Per 100K\",\n    title = \"Relationship Between Income and Access to Mental Health Care\"\n  )\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\nWarning: Removed 4 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_smooth()`).\n\n\nWarning: Removed 4 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(joint_data) +\n  geom_point(aes(x=mean_edu, y = psychol), alpha = 0.01) +\n  geom_smooth(aes(x=mean_edu, y = psychol), method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) +\n  theme (legend.position = \"none\") +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Education Level\",\n    y = \"Psychologists Per 100K\",\n    title = \"Relationship Between Income and Access to Mental Health Care\"\n  )\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\nWarning: Removed 4 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range (`stat_smooth()`).\nRemoved 4 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\nFinally, here is the relationship between average mental health in a state and number of psychologists in the state. There appears to be a negative relationship. This means that an increase in average mental wellbeing of a state correlates with a decrease in access to mental health care.\nggplot(joint_data) +\n  geom_point(aes(x=mean_total_mh, y = psychol), alpha = 0.01) +\n  geom_smooth(aes(x=mean_total_mh, y = psychol), method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) +\n  theme (legend.position = \"none\") +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Mental Wellbeing\",\n    y = \"Psychologists Per 100K\",\n    title = \"Relationship Between Mental Wellbeing and Access to Mental Health Care\"\n  )\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\nWarning: Removed 4 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_smooth()`).\n\n\nWarning: Removed 4 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\nThis comes from the file big_picture.Rmd.\nThink of this page as your 538/Upshot style article. This means that you should try to tell a story through the data and your analysis. Read articles from those sites and similar sites to get a feeling for what they are like. Try to write in the style of a news or popular article. Importantly, this page should be geared towards the general public. You shouldn’t assume the reader understands how to interpret a linear regression or a complicated plot. Focus on interpretation and visualizations."

What are you trying to show? Make sure that you explain your analysis in detail but don’t go into top much mathematics or statistics. The audience for this page is the general public (to the extent possible). Your thesis should be a statement, not a question.\nEach figure should be very polished and also not too complicated. There should be a clear interpretation of the figure so the figure has a clear purpose. Even something like a histogram can be difficult to interpret for non-experts.\n\nCreativity\n\nDo your best to make things interesting. Think of a story. Think of how each part of your analysis supports the previous part or provides a different perspective.\n\nInteractive component\n\nQuality and ease of use of the interactive components. Is it clear what can be explored using your interactive components? Does it enhance and reinforce your conclusions?\n\nThis page should be self-contained.\n\nNote: This page should have no code visible, i.e. use #| echo: FALSE."
