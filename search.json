    "text": "Overview of Household Pulse Survey Data\nThis data comes from a partnership between the Census Bureau, the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), and other federal agencies. The Household Pulse Survey is a 20-minute online survey published every two weeks, starting on April 23, 2020. The analyzed data set comes from the survey period between August 20 and September 16, 2024, and is available on the Census Bureau website.\n\nPurpose and Design of the Survey\nThe survey was developed to provide timely and relevant data on the impact of COVID-19 in the United States. While multiple federal agencies contributed to the effort, the Census Bureau led the data collection.\nThe Household Pulse Survey was specifically designed to collect data representing social and economic issues affecting American households. This data is critical for informing state and federal decisions, particularly during the peak of the pandemic when emergency response efforts were most urgent. Unlike other surveys tracking similar data, the Household Pulse Survey stands out for its frequent data collection and quicker turnaround.\n\n\nResearch and Insights\nThere have been various research efforts aimed to improve survey effectiveness and understand respondent behavior. For example:\n\nSurvey Response Strategies: Renee Reeves and Kayla Varela conducted research to evaluate the Household Pulse Survey experiments. They analyzed strategies that increased response rates, focusing on contact methods such as text vs. email and URL length. Their findings include:\n\nText messages yielded higher response rates compared to emails.\n\nShorter URLs containing “census.gov” were more effective than longer URLs.\n\nSending texts exclusively, rather than a combination of texts and emails, generated the best responses.\n\nDemographic Analysis: Other research has explored demographics of respondents and nonrespondents, particularly those who selected non-definitive response categories. Studies also examined which demographics were more likely to answer questions related to sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI).\n\n\n\nPotential Issues and Biases\nThe Household Pulse Survey has several limitations that could impact the data’s accuracy and representativeness:\n\nVoluntary and Self-Reported Date: Responses are voluntary and self-reported, potentially leading to inconsistencies in how respondents interpret scales and questions, particularly on sensitive topics like mental health, where stigmas are present. Additionally, some respondents skip questions, which limits the data’s completeness.\nNon-Participation Bias: While participants are randomly selected, those who choose not to participate may differ systematically from respondents. For example, nonparticipants may distrust the government or lack time to fill out the survey, which could correlate with survey variables.\nExclusion of Certain Populations: The survey relies on household addresses, excluding individuals experiencing homelessness, which is an important demographic when considering the impact of COVID-19.\nChanges in Question Design: Survey questions have evolved over time, potentially impacting comparability. For instance, mental health questions initially asked about symptoms over a 7-day period but later shifted to a 14-day period in Phase 3.2. This change could lead to different responses, as a longer timeframe may capture more variation in experiences."

    "text": "Data Files and Variables\nThe Household Pulse Survey dataset includes a broad range of variables, from veteran status to the impacts of natural disasters. To streamline the analysis and focus on specific areas of interest, we narrowed the scope to the following categories and variables. Variables with significant missing data, such as school type, were excluded.\n\nBasic Descriptive Variables: Birth Year, Hispanic vs. Non-Hispanic, Race, Marital Status, Gender at Birth, Gender Identity, Sexuality, State, Household Income\nEducation and Employment: Education Level, Employment Status, Job Loss, Kind of Work, Reason Not Working\nActive Duty and Veteran Status: Active Duty, Veteran\nMental Health: Anxiousness, Worry, Interest (or lack thereof), Feeling Down, Children’s Mental Health Treatment (Need for treatment, Receiving treatment, Difficulty obtaining treatment, Satisfaction with treatment), Social Support, Loneliness, Public vs. Private Health Care\n\n\nOverview of Area Health Resource Data\nWe also compared the Household Pulse Survey to the Area Health Resource Data for 2022-2023 at the State and National Level from the Health Resources & Services Administration (HRSA). The Area Health Resources Files (AHRF) dataset has over 6,000 variables with current and historical data at county, state, and national levels, covering health care professions, facilities, population characteristics, economics, and more. It is designed for planners, policymakers, and researchers, and includes geographic codes for linking with other datasets and aggregating data by region.\nThere a fewer worries of bias within this data as the numbers are not self reported. Additionally, professionals such as psychologists and social workers must be licensed in their state to practice, meaning the government has access to accurate numbers of professionals in each state. However, the simple numbers of professionals does not provide a full story of access to mental health care in a state. For example, there are questions about how many are private versus work for state institutions, what proportion work in crisis care and how many take different types of insurances. Therefore, these numbers are a good starting point to see access to care across different states, but can not give the full story.\nWe looked at the number of psychologists, social workers, counselors per state using this dataset."

This makes histograms concise (and makes regression easier). Then, columns were renamed to be more intuitive.

    "text": "This data analysis on the Household Pulse Survey focuses on understanding the relationships between mental health, mental wellbeing, and various socioeconomic and demographic factors. Data from the Health Resources and Services Administration are incorporated to provide insights into mental health providers across states. The key questions that are being addressed are:\n\nHow do measures of mental well-being (e.g. levels of worry, anxiety and other mental health indicators) change according to age, income, education, race?\nHow does access to mental health services vary based on income level, educational attainment and race/ethnicity?\n\n\n\nSummarize the findings here\n\n\n\nThe Household Pulse Survey collects data on how frequently respondents experience various mental health symptoms, including anxiety, worry, disinterest, and depression. For each symptom, respondents choose from four possible values: 1 (Not at all), 2 (Several days), 3 (More than half the days), and 4 (Nearly every day). These individual responses are then summed to create a mental health score, with a lower score indicating less frequent experience of mental health symptoms.\n\n\nWhen examining mental health trends across demographics, younger adults (18-24) report higher levels of mental health challenges compared to older age groups, with mental health scores gradually improving as age increases. This may be due to life transitions, academic or career pressures, and the impact of social media, while older individuals may experience more stability in their personal and professional lives, leading to better mental health. However, older adults may also be less likely to admit mental health struggles due to historically stronger stigmas surrounding mental health. It is also important to note that the age category of 18-24 has the least amount of data\nThe relationship between income and mental health changes: individuals with lower income initially report better mental health, but the mental health score peaks in the lower mid-range incomes. Education levels show a relatively stable relationship with mental health, with a slight downward trend as individuals attain higher levels of education, likely due to cumulative stress and life challenges over time.\nThese findings highlight the need for further investigation into how age and income intersect with mental health.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = total_mentalhealth ~ Household_Income, data = scatter_data)\n\nResiduals:\n   Min     1Q Median     3Q    Max \n-6.898 -1.872 -1.257  1.307 10.743 \n\nCoefficients:\n                  Estimate Std.

The overall measure of mental health or the Total Mental Health Score was calculated by totaling the other measures of mental health. When income is plotted against average mental health score, both total and individual measures, there shows a slight decrease in the mental health measures as income increases. This demonstrates a correlation between increased income and improved mental health. This decrease is much clearer when examining the total mental health score rather than individual measures.\nWhen regressed against income, total mental health score decreases by 0.21 when income increases by one level. The t-statistic is -34.82 and the p-value is less than 2e-16, demonstrating that the coefficient is statistically significant.

As level of educational attainment increase, mental wellbeing improves. This is unsurprising as educational attainment is often correlated with income level as well. The linear regression shows that as educational attainment increases by one, total mental health score decreases by 0.21. This is statistically significant as the t-value is -24.56.

The key questions that are being addressed are:\n\nHow do measures of mental well-being (e.g. levels of worry, anxiety and other mental health indicators) change according to age, income, education, race?\nHow does access to mental health services vary based on income level, educational attainment and race/ethnicity?\n\n\n\nSummarize the findings here\n\n\n\nThe Household Pulse Survey collects data on how frequently respondents experience various mental health symptoms, including anxiety, worry, disinterest, and depression. For each symptom, respondents choose from four possible values: 1 (Not at all), 2 (Several days), 3 (More than half the days), and 4 (Nearly every day). These individual responses are then summed to create a mental health score, with a lower score indicating less frequent experience of mental health symptoms.\n\n\nWhen examining mental health trends across demographics, younger adults (18-24) report higher levels of mental health challenges compared to older age groups, with mental health scores gradually improving as age increases. This may be due to life transitions, academic or career pressures, and the impact of social media, while older individuals may experience more stability in their personal and professional lives, leading to better mental health. However, older adults may also be less likely to admit mental health struggles due to historically stronger stigmas surrounding mental health. It is also important to note that the age category of 18-24 has the least amount of data\nThe relationship between income and mental health changes: individuals with lower income initially report better mental health, but the mental health score peaks in the lower mid-range incomes. Education levels show a relatively stable relationship with mental health, with a slight downward trend as individuals attain higher levels of education, likely due to cumulative stress and life challenges over time.\nThese findings highlight the need for further investigation into how age and income intersect with mental health.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = total_mentalhealth ~ Household_Income, data = scatter_data)\n\nResiduals:\n   Min     1Q Median     3Q    Max \n-6.898 -1.872 -1.257  1.307 10.743 \n\nCoefficients:\n                  Estimate Std.

The overall measure of mental health or the Total Mental Health Score was calculated by totaling the other measures of mental health. When income is plotted against average mental health score, both total and individual measures, there shows a slight decrease in the mental health measures as income increases. This demonstrates a correlation between increased income and improved mental health. This decrease is much clearer when examining the total mental health score rather than individual measures.\nWhen regressed against income, total mental health score decreases by 0.21 when income increases by one level. The t-statistic is -34.82 and the p-value is less than 2e-16, demonstrating that the coefficient is statistically significant.

As level of educational attainment increase, mental wellbeing improves. This is unsurprising as educational attainment is often correlated with income level as well. The linear regression shows that as educational attainment increases by one, total mental health score decreases by 0.21. This is statistically significant as the t-value is -24.56.

This page will provide an overview of what questions you addressed, illustrations of relevant aspects of the data with tables and figures, and a statistical model that attempts to answer part of the question. You’ll also reflect on next steps and further analysis.\nThe audience for this page is someone like your class mates, so you can expect that they have some level of statistical and quantitative sophistication and understand ideas like linear and logistic regression, coefficients, confidence intervals, overfitting, etc.\nWhile the exact number of figures and tables will vary and depend on your analysis, you should target around 5 to 6. An overly long analysis could lead to losing points. If you want you can link back to your blog posts or create separate pages with more details.\nThe style of this paper should aim to be that of an academic paper. I don’t expect this to be of publication quality but you should keep that aim in mind. Avoid using “we” too frequently, for example “We also found that …”. Describe your methodology and your findings but don’t describe your whole process.\nYou will\n\nIntroduce what motivates your Data Analysis (DA)\n\nWhich variables and relationships are you most interested in?\nWhat questions are you interested in answering?\nProvide context for the rest of the page. This will include figures/tables that illustrate aspects of the data of your question.\n\nModeling and Inference\n\nThe page will include some kind of formal statistical model. This could be a linear regression, logistic regression, or another modeling framework.\nExplain the ideas and techniques you used to choose the predictors for your model. (Think about including interaction terms and other transformations of your variables.)\nDescribe the results of your modelling and make sure to give a sense of the uncertainty in your estimates and conclusions.\n\nExplain the flaws and limitations of your analysis\n\nAre there some assumptions that you needed to make that might not hold? Is there other data that would help to answer your questions?\n\nClarity Figures\n\nAre your figures/tables/results easy to read, informative, without problems like overplotting, hard-to-read labels, etc?\nEach figure should provide a key insight. Too many figures or other data summaries can detract from this. (While not a hard limit, around 5 total figures is probably a good target.)\nDefault lm output and plots are typically not acceptable.\n\nClarity of Explanations\n\nHow well do you explain each figure/result?\nDo you provide interpretations that suggest further analysis or explanations for observed phenomenon?\n\nOrganization and cleanliness.\n\nMake sure to remove excessive warnings, hide most or all code, organize with sections or multiple pages, use bullets, etc.\nThis page should be self-contained, i.e. provide a description of the relevant data."

    "text": "This week, we finished merging our two datasets. We had some initial issues because we had to make adjustments to our primary dataset by assigning new values to a column. The column “EST_ST,” representing the state that the participants live in, had values 1-50 to reflect each state. However, the dataset that we are merging (healthcare accessibility data) had the states written out to reflect where participants lived, so we had to convert values (Alabama = 1, Alaska = 2, …). Once this was changed, we were able to merge the data and perform initial analyses.\nWe spent the majority of this week fixing the errors in the merging of our data. Our goal for the coming week is to continue working on analyses of the combined data. Eventually, our plan is to create a series of maps to compare states.\nWe created some plots to explore what the relationship between our variables that are new to the data: psychol_21 (number of psychologists in the state), socwk_21 (number of social workers in the state), conslrs_21 (number of counselors in the state). We faceted 3 plots where these were the x values and the y were the average mental health values grouped by state. The results are below:\n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt seems that there is a slight increase of mental health values as the number of specialists increase. These findings are important because they show that a higher number of specialists benefits the mental health of the state population, although the increase is not very high. We will continue to work with this data in order to find more insight between the number of specialists and the variables of importance in our original dataset."

Some of our ideas included joining datasets concerning COVID-19, healthcare accessibility, unemployment rates, and weather, all joined on either date or region. The COVID-19 dataset could account for any anomalies within our data during the pandemic’s peak, specifically recognizing changes in unemployment status and income, which may have impacted mental health. Healthcare accessibility could influence mental health, as proximity to care facilities affects the frequency of seeing medical providers. Unemployment rates by region could illustrate which places have the highest and lowest unemployment rates, and from there, we could compare which groups of people are most likely to reside in certain regions and whether their demographics impact or are impacted by other variables. Lastly, weather data could find correlations between time of year and poor mental health, potentially showing the effects of seasonal depression. By accounting for these outside variables (the COVID-19 pandemic, accessibility to healthcare facilities, unemployment status by location, and seasonal depression), we could train our model better to recognize these influences.\nWe ultimately chose to assess healthcare accessibility data, specifically the 2022-2023 State and National Level Data. One challenge with this dataset is that it has 6000 variables, but we have selected to examine specific access to providers, like social workers, primary care, psychologists, child psychiatrists, and a few others. We are merging this data on “state” to determine how healthcare accessibility varies by region and impacts mental health. We have not yet finished combining the dataset, so we do not have any preliminary analyses. Our next step is to clean the data, and from there, we can determine any initial findings.\n\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_bin()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbove are a few histograms that outline the distribution of the proportion of # of each type of specialist per person. The distributions seem to be very similar, with high counts near the left side of the range, and a right-skewed shape. This shows us that many of the proportions of specialists in each state does not seem to vary much, however there are some states with proportions of specialists that are much higher than others. We will continue to analyze this data to see if there are connections that we can create between healthcare accessibility and the other mental health statistics."

    "text": "During this week, we continued to clean and explore the Household Pulse Survey data that we chose. Within the cleaning procedure, we have removed all columns that do not align with what we want to focus on, which is mental health. We reduced the column size from about 220 to 43, making the data much more manageable for our data processing. Furthermore, we have modified the source’s null values, which were -88, into NULL values to change the data into a form that we are comfortable with.\nNow that we have cleaned our data, we are also able to do some exploratory data analysis to see some initial trends and potential biases within our data. Our data cleaning and exploration can be found in the data segment of the project, but below is one of our most interesting graphs:\n\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a graph that shows the distribution of a participant’s birth year, and while also showing the difficulty of finding mental health treatment for their children. The first thing to notice is that most of the birth years are centralized between 1970 - 1990, and this is probably because most of the people who are considered parents within the survey were born between 1970-1990. The colors that represent the difficulty of finding mental health shows high counts of 1 and 2, implying that it is not very difficult to find mental health resources for children. We plan on working on analyzing mental health data, so these preliminary graphs can help us understand some things about the data that are not visible from just looking at the table."

We are also mindful that there are potential biases from this dataset and other research has shown how certain question orderings impact responses.

    "text": "Data for Equity\n\nBeneficence:\nOne of the principles for advancing equitable data practice is to “be transparent about the limits of the data”. This is relevant to our data because the data from the Household Pulse Survey is voluntary and self-reported, possibly leading to different interpretations for each question, especially ones regarding mental health. This principle entails adding disclaimers to the data analysis. Without transparency, the analysis could be misinterpreted and abused.\n\n\nJustice\nAnother principle is to “return data and research results to community members in a form they can use”. This is important so members who were surveyed for the Household Pulse Survey can benefit and learn from the data collection. We will do this for our data by presenting the analysis in an accessible and organized format on the group project website."

Today, you will just be brainstorming, and then next week, you’ll get started on the main aspects of the project.\n\nStart by introducing yourselves to each other. I also recommend creating a private channel on Microsoft Teams with all your team members. This will be a place that you can communicate and share ideas, code, problems, etc.\nDiscuss what aspects of the project each of you are more or less excited about. These include\n\nCollecting, cleaning, and munging data ,\nStatistical Modeling,\nVisualization,\nWriting about analyses, and\nManaging and reviewing team work.\n\nBased on this, discuss where you feel your strengths and weaknesses might be.\nNext, start brainstorming questions you hope to answer as part of this project. This question should in some way be addressing issues around racial disparities. The questions you come up with should be at the level of the question we started with when exploring the HMDA data. (“Are there differences in the ease of securing a loan based on the race of the applicant?”) You’ll revise your questions a lot over the course of the project. Come up with a few questions that your group might be interested in exploring.\nBased on these questions, start looking around for data that might help you analyze this. If you are looking at U.S. based data, data.gov is a good source and if you are looking internationally, I recommend checking out the World Bank. Also, try Googling for data. Include “data set” or “dataset” in your query. You might even include “CSV” or some other format. Using “data” by itself in your query often doesn’t work too well. Spend some time searching for data and try to come up with at least three possible data sets. (For your first blog post, you’ll write short proposals about each of them that I’ll give feedback on.)\nCome up with a team name. Next week, I’ll provide the Github Classroom assignment that will be where you work on your final project and you’ll have to have your team name finalized by then. Your project will be hosted online at the website with a URL like sussmanbu.github.io/ma4615-fa23-final-project-TEAMNAME.\n\nNext time, you’ll get your final project website set up and write your first blog post."

    "text": "Household Pulse Survey | Dataset\nThe Household Pulse Survey surveys households across the country on a variety of different measures of wellbeing including mental health, food access, and housing. This survey has been collected since 2020 and is collected using a two weeks on, two weeks off approach. This means that there are several data sets spanning the past four years. Looking at one survey period, there are 51281 rows and 163 columns.\nThe data is collected to get quick information on the social and economic wellbeing of households across the country. Looking at this data we could examine changes in mental health across different states and over the past four years. We could also look at different economic factors for example housing and food insecurity across time and regions. There are several potential challenges with this data set. First, since this survey is distributed so frequently, there are close to 60 data sets per year which may be difficult to sift through. Additionally, as the data looks at a wide range of factors it may be difficult to focus on one or two."

The dataset dates from 1999 to 2018, with 6228 rows and 16 columns. The CDC has released datasets containing this information annually since 1999 and has data up to 2019, but isn’t publicly available on their website.\nWe are hoping to analyze the disparities in drug overdoses based on race from the 20 years of data collection. From the data, we could also determine which races have the highest access (potentially finding what race the majority of the youngest age, documented as “Under 15 years,” drug overdoses occur) to certain drugs e.g. heroin and natural and semisynthetic opioids, and the death rates associated with each drug. The time progression can show trends in access to drugs and deaths, although a possible challenge is that we might see rising numbers in deaths solely as a byproduct of the growing population. This might mean we need to standardize the data with respect to population count. Another concern is there are 11 values in the “STUB_LABEL” column, so we may need to group columns to visualize the effects of race on drug overdose better."

    "text": "During this week, we have further cleaned the data to prepare it for modeling and analysis. Some of the changes we have made to the data are to make the data more comprehensive without a data dictionary. For example, the column ACTVDUTY1 represents whether one or one’s spouse currently is not active in the U.S. Armed Forces. We changed the column name to Not_Currently_Serving_in_US_Armed_Forces. We have also changed the row data since our row data was just numbers that represented values. For example, for the row RHISPANIC, which has been renamed to Hispanic, the values within the column is either 1 or 2, based on whether the person is hispanic or not. We have changed it to Yes or No to help us understand the data more efficiently.\nOther than cleaning, we have begun putting effort into modeling and analysis. We have created a new column that aggregates the values within the mental health columns such as anxiety, worry, feeling down, and interest. This will help us understand the effect of certain variables on mental health overall. With this new column, we were able to compare it to household income using the lm() function in R. The results of our model are interesting, and some of our results can be seen below with our Normal QQ plot:\n\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot shows that our distribution of residuals are not normally distributed.

What are you trying to show? Make sure that you explain your analysis in detail but don’t go into top much mathematics or statistics. The audience for this page is the general public (to the extent possible). Your thesis should be a statement, not a question.\nEach figure should be very polished and also not too complicated. There should be a clear interpretation of the figure so the figure has a clear purpose. Even something like a histogram can be difficult to interpret for non-experts.\n\nCreativity\n\nDo your best to make things interesting. Think of a story. Think of how each part of your analysis supports the previous part or provides a different perspective.\n\nInteractive component\n\nQuality and ease of use of the interactive components. Is it clear what can be explored using your interactive components? Does it enhance and reinforce your conclusions?\n\nThis page should be self-contained.\n\nNote: This page should have no code visible, i.e. use #| echo: FALSE."

You should provide a quick explanation of your data and demonstrate some of the conclusions from your EDA. This video should be no longer than 4 minutes. Include a link to your video (and password if needed) in your README.md file on your Github repository. You are not required to provide a link on the website. This can be presented by any subset of the team members.\n\n\nRest of the Site\nFinally, here are important things to keep in mind for the rest of the site.\nThe main title of your page is informative. Each post has an author/description/informative title. All lab required posts are present. Each page (including the home page) has a nice featured image associated with it. Your about page is up to date and clean. You have removed the generic posts from the initial site template."
