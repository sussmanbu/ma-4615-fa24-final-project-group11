    "section": "Overview of Household Pulse Survey Data",
    "text": "Overview of Household Pulse Survey Data\nThis data comes from a partnership between the Census Bureau, the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), and other federal agencies. The Household Pulse Survey is a 20-minute online survey published every two weeks, starting on April 23, 2020. The analyzed data set comes from the survey period between August 20 and September 16, 2024, and is available on the Census Bureau website.\n\nPurpose and Design of the Survey\nThe survey was developed to provide timely and relevant data on the impact of COVID-19 in the United States. While multiple federal agencies contributed to the effort, the Census Bureau led the data collection.\nThe Household Pulse Survey was specifically designed to collect data representing social and economic issues affecting American households. This data is critical for informing state and federal decisions, particularly during the peak of the pandemic when emergency response efforts were most urgent. Unlike other surveys tracking similar data, the Household Pulse Survey stands out for its frequent data collection and quicker turnaround.\n\n\nResearch and Insights\nThere have been various research efforts aimed to improve survey effectiveness and understand respondent behavior. For example:\n\nSurvey Response Strategies: Renee Reeves and Kayla Varela conducted research to evaluate the Household Pulse Survey experiments. They analyzed strategies that increased response rates, focusing on contact methods such as text vs. email and URL length. Their findings include:\n\nText messages yielded higher response rates compared to emails.\n\nShorter URLs containing “census.gov” were more effective than longer URLs.\n\nSending texts exclusively, rather than a combination of texts and emails, generated the best responses.\n\nDemographic Analysis: Other research has explored demographics of respondents and nonrespondents, particularly those who selected non-definitive response categories. Studies also examined which demographics were more likely to answer questions related to sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI).\n\n\n\nPotential Issues and Biases\nThe Household Pulse Survey has several limitations that could impact the data’s accuracy and representativeness:\n\nVoluntary and Self-Reported Date: Responses are voluntary and self-reported, potentially leading to inconsistencies in how respondents interpret scales and questions, particularly on sensitive topics like mental health, where stigmas are present. Additionally, some respondents skip questions, which limits the data’s completeness.\nNon-Participation Bias: While participants are randomly selected, those who choose not to participate may differ systematically from respondents. For example, nonparticipants may distrust the government or lack time to fill out the survey, which could correlate with survey variables.\nExclusion of Certain Populations: The survey relies on household addresses, excluding individuals experiencing homelessness, which is an important demographic when considering the impact of COVID-19.\nChanges in Question Design: Survey questions have evolved over time, potentially impacting comparability. For instance, mental health questions initially asked about symptoms over a 7-day period but later shifted to a 14-day period in Phase 3.2. This change could lead to different responses, as a longer timeframe may capture more variation in experiences."

    "text": "Data Files and Variables\nThe Household Pulse Survey dataset includes a broad range of variables, from veteran status to the impacts of natural disasters. To streamline the analysis and focus on specific areas of interest, we narrowed the scope to the following categories and variables. Variables with significant missing data, such as school type, were excluded.\n\nBasic Descriptive Variables: Birth Year, Hispanic vs. Non-Hispanic, Race, Marital Status, Gender at Birth, Gender Identity, Sexuality, State, Household Income\nEducation and Employment: Education Level, Employment Status, Job Loss, Kind of Work, Reason Not Working\nActive Duty and Veteran Status: Active Duty, Veteran\nMental Health: Anxiousness, Worry, Interest (or lack thereof), Feeling Down, Children’s Mental Health Treatment (Need for treatment, Receiving treatment, Difficulty obtaining treatment, Satisfaction with treatment), Social Support, Loneliness, Public vs. Private Health Care\n\n\nOverview of Area Health Resource Data\nWe also compared the Household Pulse Survey to the Area Health Resource Data for 2022-2023 at the State and National Level from the Health Resources & Services Administration (HRSA). The Area Health Resources Files (AHRF) dataset has over 6,000 variables with current and historical data at county, state, and national levels, covering health care professions, facilities, population characteristics, economics, and more. It is designed for planners, policymakers, and researchers, and includes geographic codes for linking with other datasets and aggregating data by region.\nThere a fewer worries of bias within this data as the numbers are not self reported. Additionally, professionals such as psychologists and social workers must be licensed in their state to practice, meaning the government has access to accurate numbers of professionals in each state. However, the simple numbers of professionals does not provide a full story of access to mental health care in a state. For example, there are questions about how many are private versus work for state institutions, what proportion work in crisis care and how many take different types of insurances. Therefore, these numbers are a good starting point to see access to care across different states, but can not give the full story.\nWe looked at the number of psychologists, social workers, counselors per state using this dataset."

    "section": "I. Frequency of Mental Health Symptoms",
    "text": "I. Frequency of Mental Health Symptoms\nThe Household Pulse Survey collects data on how frequently respondents experience various mental health symptoms, including anxiety, worry, disinterest, and depression. For each symptom, respondents choose from four possible values: 1 (Not at all), 2 (Several days), 3 (More than half the days), and 4 (Nearly every day). These individual responses are then summed to create a mental health score, with a lower score indicating less frequent experience of mental health symptoms.\n\nBasic Analysis\nWhen examining mental health trends across demographics, younger adults (18-24) report higher levels of mental health challenges compared to older age groups, with mental health scores gradually improving as age increases. This may be due to life transitions, academic or career pressures, and the impact of social media, while older individuals may experience more stability in their personal and professional lives, leading to better mental health. However, older adults may also be less likely to admit mental health struggles due to historically stronger stigmas surrounding mental health. It is also important to note that the age category of 18-24 has the least amount of data\nThe relationship between income and mental health changes: individuals with lower income initially report better mental health, but the mental health score peaks in the lower mid-range incomes. Education levels show a relatively stable relationship with mental health, with a slight downward trend as individuals attain higher levels of education, likely due to cumulative stress and life challenges over time.\nThese findings highlight the need for further investigation into how age and income intersect with mental health.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinear Regression Model\nBefore performing linear regression, the data is prepared via the prepare_data function. This function processes mental health survey data by calculating the average frequencies of anxiety, worry, loss of interest, and depression across age, income, and education level. Then it restructures the data into a long format, where each row represents a specific mental health metric for a particular demographic value.\nAfter the data is prepared for linear regression, the plots are created using the create_plot function. This creates a line plot showing the relationships between mental health metrics and demographic variables (age, income, and education), and Q-Q plots for each relationship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinear Regression Analysis\nBased on these plots, the demographic variables have the following relationship with the mental health indicators:\n\nAge: This demographic variable has the strongest relationship among the mental health indicators. Young adults (around age 20) report the highest levels of mental health concerns, with scores around 1.75-2.0, while older adults (80+) report much lower levels, around 1.25.\nEducation: There is a moderate negative relationship with mental health issues. As educational attainment increases, reported mental health concerns decrease gradually. However, the slope is less steep than with age, suggesting a weaker effect.\nIncome: Higher incomes are associated with slightly lower mental health concerns.\n\nAcross all three plots, anxiety constantly demonstrates the highest reported frequency across age, education, and income levels.\nLooking at the Q-Q plots, the residuals for all three demographic variables show reasonable normality in the middle ranges, but have some deviations at the tails. Out of the three demographics, age has the most consistent normality across the distribution, suggesting that age is the most reliable predictor of mental health outcomes in this dataset.\nThe summary statistics for the linear regressions show that older age, higher income, and greater education are all significantly associated with better mental health. However, there is a lot of variance. Age has the strongest effect, with mental health scores decreasing by 0.0117 points per year (p &lt; 0.001), followed by income (-0.0564 per category, p &lt; 2.99e-316), and education (-0.0547 per level, p &lt; 5.76e-148). This aligns with the initial findings in the basic analysis."

    "text": "This week, we finished merging our two datasets. We had some initial issues because we had to make adjustments to our primary dataset by assigning new values to a column. The column “EST_ST,” representing the state that the participants live in, had values 1-50 to reflect each state. However, the dataset that we are merging (healthcare accessibility data) had the states written out to reflect where participants lived, so we had to convert values (Alabama = 1, Alaska = 2, …). Once this was changed, we were able to merge the data and perform initial analyses.\nWe spent the majority of this week fixing the errors in the merging of our data. Our goal for the coming week is to continue working on analyses of the combined data. Eventually, our plan is to create a series of maps to compare states.\nWe created some plots to explore what the relationship between our variables that are new to the data: psychol_21 (number of psychologists in the state), socwk_21 (number of social workers in the state), conslrs_21 (number of counselors in the state). We faceted 3 plots where these were the x values and the y were the average mental health values grouped by state. The results are below:\n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt seems that there is a slight increase of mental health values as the number of specialists increase. These findings are important because they show that a higher number of specialists benefits the mental health of the state population, although the increase is not very high. We will continue to work with this data in order to find more insight between the number of specialists and the variables of importance in our original dataset."

    "text": "We looked into various datasets that could be joined with ours, allowing a more in-depth analysis. Some of our ideas included joining datasets concerning COVID-19, healthcare accessibility, unemployment rates, and weather, all joined on either date or region. The COVID-19 dataset could account for any anomalies within our data during the pandemic’s peak, specifically recognizing changes in unemployment status and income, which may have impacted mental health. Healthcare accessibility could influence mental health, as proximity to care facilities affects the frequency of seeing medical providers. Unemployment rates by region could illustrate which places have the highest and lowest unemployment rates, and from there, we could compare which groups of people are most likely to reside in certain regions and whether their demographics impact or are impacted by other variables. Lastly, weather data could find correlations between time of year and poor mental health, potentially showing the effects of seasonal depression. By accounting for these outside variables (the COVID-19 pandemic, accessibility to healthcare facilities, unemployment status by location, and seasonal depression), we could train our model better to recognize these influences.\nWe ultimately chose to assess healthcare accessibility data, specifically the 2022-2023 State and National Level Data. One challenge with this dataset is that it has 6000 variables, but we have selected to examine specific access to providers, like social workers, primary care, psychologists, child psychiatrists, and a few others. We are merging this data on “state” to determine how healthcare accessibility varies by region and impacts mental health. We have not yet finished combining the dataset, so we do not have any preliminary analyses. Our next step is to clean the data, and from there, we can determine any initial findings.\n\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_bin()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbove are a few histograms that outline the distribution of the proportion of # of each type of specialist per person. The distributions seem to be very similar, with high counts near the left side of the range, and a right-skewed shape. This shows us that many of the proportions of specialists in each state does not seem to vary much, however there are some states with proportions of specialists that are much higher than others. We will continue to analyze this data to see if there are connections that we can create between healthcare accessibility and the other mental health statistics."

Furthermore, we have modified the source’s null values, which were -88, into NULL values to change the data into a form that we are comfortable with.\nNow that we have cleaned our data, we are also able to do some exploratory data analysis to see some initial trends and potential biases within our data.

The colors that represent the difficulty of finding mental health shows high counts of 1 and 2, implying that it is not very difficult to find mental health resources for children. We plan on working on analyzing mental health data, so these preliminary graphs can help us understand some things about the data that are not visible from just looking at the table."

    "text": "This past week, we finalized our data set, the Household Pulse Survey, and have been focused on fine-tuning our data. We had an issue last week where our blog post wasn’t published, despite committing it to our main page, which we resolved during class. Because Professor Sussman wasn’t able to view our first blog post where we pitched our dataset, we ran it by him in class and he approved. We are also mindful that there are potential biases from this dataset and other research has shown how certain question orderings impact responses. Despite this, we are continuing to explore this dataset because it’s guided federal emergency responses during the peak of COVID-19, meaning it’s played a significant role in policy."

    "text": "Data for Equity\n\nBeneficence:\nOne of the principles for advancing equitable data practice is to “be transparent about the limits of the data”. This is relevant to our data because the data from the Household Pulse Survey is voluntary and self-reported, possibly leading to different interpretations for each question, especially ones regarding mental health. This principle entails adding disclaimers to the data analysis. Without transparency, the analysis could be misinterpreted and abused.\n\n\nJustice\nAnother principle is to “return data and research results to community members in a form they can use”. This is important so members who were surveyed for the Household Pulse Survey can benefit and learn from the data collection. We will do this for our data by presenting the analysis in an accessible and organized format on the group project website."

    "text": "These are the steps that you will take today to get started on your project. Today, you will just be brainstorming, and then next week, you’ll get started on the main aspects of the project.\n\nStart by introducing yourselves to each other. I also recommend creating a private channel on Microsoft Teams with all your team members. This will be a place that you can communicate and share ideas, code, problems, etc.\nDiscuss what aspects of the project each of you are more or less excited about. These include\n\nCollecting, cleaning, and munging data ,\nStatistical Modeling,\nVisualization,\nWriting about analyses, and\nManaging and reviewing team work.\n\nBased on this, discuss where you feel your strengths and weaknesses might be.\nNext, start brainstorming questions you hope to answer as part of this project. This question should in some way be addressing issues around racial disparities. The questions you come up with should be at the level of the question we started with when exploring the HMDA data. (“Are there differences in the ease of securing a loan based on the race of the applicant?”) You’ll revise your questions a lot over the course of the project. Come up with a few questions that your group might be interested in exploring.\nBased on these questions, start looking around for data that might help you analyze this. If you are looking at U.S. based data, data.gov is a good source and if you are looking internationally, I recommend checking out the World Bank. Also, try Googling for data. Include “data set” or “dataset” in your query. You might even include “CSV” or some other format. Using “data” by itself in your query often doesn’t work too well. Spend some time searching for data and try to come up with at least three possible data sets. (For your first blog post, you’ll write short proposals about each of them that I’ll give feedback on.)\nCome up with a team name. Next week, I’ll provide the Github Classroom assignment that will be where you work on your final project and you’ll have to have your team name finalized by then. Your project will be hosted online at the website with a URL like sussmanbu.github.io/ma4615-fa23-final-project-TEAMNAME.\n\nNext time, you’ll get your final project website set up and write your first blog post."

Each year and 10-year period contains 50,176 rows. About half of the values for “Data_Value” are na (empty), possibly because some demographics are not represented in state populations.\nWe may be more interested in looking at individual years, as 1. the total dataset amounts to over 1 million rows, and 2. the rows concerning 10-year trends are calculated through a Bayesian model and do not represent raw data."

    "text": "Household Pulse Survey | Dataset\nThe Household Pulse Survey surveys households across the country on a variety of different measures of wellbeing including mental health, food access, and housing. This survey has been collected since 2020 and is collected using a two weeks on, two weeks off approach. This means that there are several data sets spanning the past four years. Looking at one survey period, there are 51281 rows and 163 columns.\nThe data is collected to get quick information on the social and economic wellbeing of households across the country. Looking at this data we could examine changes in mental health across different states and over the past four years. We could also look at different economic factors for example housing and food insecurity across time and regions. There are several potential challenges with this data set. First, since this survey is distributed so frequently, there are close to 60 data sets per year which may be difficult to sift through. Additionally, as the data looks at a wide range of factors it may be difficult to focus on one or two."

    "text": "Drug Overdose Death Rates | Dataset\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention documented drug overdose death rates based on drug type, sex, age, race, and Hispanic origin. The dataset dates from 1999 to 2018, with 6228 rows and 16 columns. The CDC has released datasets containing this information annually since 1999 and has data up to 2019, but isn’t publicly available on their website.\nWe are hoping to analyze the disparities in drug overdoses based on race from the 20 years of data collection. From the data, we could also determine which races have the highest access (potentially finding what race the majority of the youngest age, documented as “Under 15 years,” drug overdoses occur) to certain drugs e.g. heroin and natural and semisynthetic opioids, and the death rates associated with each drug. The time progression can show trends in access to drugs and deaths, although a possible challenge is that we might see rising numbers in deaths solely as a byproduct of the growing population. This might mean we need to standardize the data with respect to population count. Another concern is there are 11 values in the “STUB_LABEL” column, so we may need to group columns to visualize the effects of race on drug overdose better."

    "text": "During this week, we have further cleaned the data to prepare it for modeling and analysis. Some of the changes we have made to the data are to make the data more comprehensive without a data dictionary. For example, the column ACTVDUTY1 represents whether one or one’s spouse currently is not active in the U.S. Armed Forces. We changed the column name to Not_Currently_Serving_in_US_Armed_Forces. We have also changed the row data since our row data was just numbers that represented values. For example, for the row RHISPANIC, which has been renamed to Hispanic, the values within the column is either 1 or 2, based on whether the person is hispanic or not. We have changed it to Yes or No to help us understand the data more efficiently.\nOther than cleaning, we have begun putting effort into modeling and analysis. We have created a new column that aggregates the values within the mental health columns such as anxiety, worry, feeling down, and interest. This will help us understand the effect of certain variables on mental health overall. With this new column, we were able to compare it to household income using the lm() function in R. The results of our model are interesting, and some of our results can be seen below with our Normal QQ plot:\n\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot shows that our distribution of residuals are not normally distributed. Within the middle quantiles, the residuals follow the normal distribution, but the farther quantiles from the mean show a difference from the normal distribution. These differences imply that within the farther quantiles, the data says very similar in their residuals, signaling that there may be some sort of boundaries in our data that the data cannot exceed."

Mental wellbeing is measured through the Household Pulse Survey where families reported the frequency of certain mental health symptoms such as loneliness, anxiety and feeling down. These were then totaled to find an overall measure of mental wellbeing. Age, income and education level also come from the Household Pulse Survey.\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\nWarning: Removed 1 row containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_smooth()`).\n\n\nWarning: Removed 1 row containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\nWarning: Removed 1 row containing non-finite outside the scale range (`stat_smooth()`).\nRemoved 1 row containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\nWarning: Removed 7 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_smooth()`).\n\n\nWarning: Removed 7 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\nHere are the relationships between access to mental health (represented by the number of psychologists in a state) and income and education level of each step. There appears to be a slight positive correlation between both income and education level and access to mental health. This means higher income and education levels in a state correspond with higher numbers of psychologists.

What are you trying to show? Make sure that you explain your analysis in detail but don’t go into top much mathematics or statistics. The audience for this page is the general public (to the extent possible). Your thesis should be a statement, not a question.\nEach figure should be very polished and also not too complicated. There should be a clear interpretation of the figure so the figure has a clear purpose. Even something like a histogram can be difficult to interpret for non-experts.\n\nCreativity\n\nDo your best to make things interesting. Think of a story. Think of how each part of your analysis supports the previous part or provides a different perspective.\n\nInteractive component\n\nQuality and ease of use of the interactive components. Is it clear what can be explored using your interactive components? Does it enhance and reinforce your conclusions?\n\nThis page should be self-contained.\n\nNote: This page should have no code visible, i.e. use #| echo: FALSE."

You should provide a quick explanation of your data and demonstrate some of the conclusions from your EDA. This video should be no longer than 4 minutes. Include a link to your video (and password if needed) in your README.md file on your Github repository. You are not required to provide a link on the website. This can be presented by any subset of the team members.\n\n\nRest of the Site\nFinally, here are important things to keep in mind for the rest of the site.\nThe main title of your page is informative. Each post has an author/description/informative title. All lab required posts are present. Each page (including the home page) has a nice featured image associated with it. Your about page is up to date and clean. You have removed the generic posts from the initial site template."
