It is a 20 minute online survey and is published every 2 weeks beginning on April 23, 2020. The specific data we are looking at from the August 20 - September 16, 2024 survey period and can be found on the Census Bureau website.\nThe survey was designed to complement the ability of the federal statistical system to rapidly respond and provide relevant information about the impact of COVID-19 in the United States. While the data was collected with a variety of federal agencies, collection was lead by the Census Bureau.\nThe data for the Household Pulse Survey was collected in response to COVID-19 in order to quickly respond and provide relevant information about the pandemic in the United States. This produces data representing social and economic matters affecting American households, which gets released in near real-time to determine state and federal action. For instance, this survey guiding emergency responses was fundamental, primarily during the pandemic’s peak. There are surveys that track similar data, but the data collection rate is not as frequent and the turnaround time is typically longer. There is existing research on this data. This includes a project evaluating the household pulse survey experiments, and focuses on how the survey can be more effective. Renee Reeves and Kayla Varela, the leads of this research, asked what implementations resulted in higher response rates, particularly contact strategies, e.g., text vs. email, short URL vs. long URL. Reeves and Varela determined that sending texts instead of emails, using shorter URLs containing census.gov over longer URLs, and sending only texts instead of both texts and emails generate more responses. There is a range of other research, including identifying the demographic characteristics of nonrespondents and respondents who select non-definitive response categories, as well as which demographics were more likely to respond to sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) questions.\n\n\nThe main issue with this data is that it is voluntary and self reported. This means that individuals may have different interpretations of the scales and numbers especially as it relates to levels of worry, anxiety, and loneliness. This is particularly the case for mental health data as there remains a lot of stigma around mental health, however, it is also harder to collect other more accurate data. Further demonstrating this problem, there are several questions that respondents skipped and did not answer.\nAdditionally, while people are randomly selected to participate, they have the option not to participate. Those that opt out of participating may be more distrustful of the government or too busy to take the time to fill out the survey. Both of these factors could be correlated with other variables in the survey. Respondents are also selected using household addresses. This automatically excludes people experiencing homelessness, as they may not have a household address.\nFurther, the data questioning has changed throughout the phases of the survey. Before Phase 3.2, the screening questions for mental health concerns asked “Over the last 7 days, how often have you been bothered by … having little interest or pleasure in doing things? Would you say not at all, several days, more than half the days, or nearly every day?” Phase 3.2 altered the question to “Over the last 14 days,” as opposed to the previously stated “7 days.” This could have changed responses given the timeframe is different — having a larger number of days n is more likely to create more varying data since there is more data to report. So, someone might respond “more than half the days” in a 14-day span, but “several days” in a 7-day span."

However, we decided to make the data more manageable and focused by only examining the following variables that we were particularly interested in. We also took out variable where a large portion of the data was missing, including school type.\nWe kept basic descriptive variables of individuals such as Birth Year, State, Race and Ethnicity, Marital Status, Gender and Sexuality. We also wanted to include information about education and employment to see if that factored into mental health data. This includes level of education, school type (public, private, homeschooled) for children in the household, employment status, job loss and reason for not working. We also included if an individual was active duty or a veteran. Finally we examined the specific variables regarding mental health:\n\nAnxiousness\nWorry\nInterest\nFeeling Down\nChildren’s Mental Health Treatment (Need, if they received treatment, difficulty in finding treatment)\nSocial Support and Loneliness\nPrivate v Public Health Care\n\nOur full list of variables is used is as follows:\nBasic Descriptors Variables * Birth Year * Hispanic v Non-Hispanic * Race * Marital Status * Gender at Birth * Gender Identity * Sexuality * State * Household Income\nEducation and Employment * Education Level * Job Loss * Employment Status * Kind of Work * Reason not Working\nActive Duty and Veteran Status * Active Duty * Veteran\nMental Health * Anxious * Worry * Interest * Down * Children need for mental health treatment * Children receiving mental health treatment * Difficulty in obtaining treatment * Satisfaction with treatment * Social Support * Loneliness * Public vs Private Health Care"

This will be ignored by git (based off the .gitignore file in the project root directory) which will help you avoid issues with Github’s size limits. Your team will have to manually make sure the data files in dataset-ignore are synced across team members.\nYour load_and_clean_data.R file is how you will load and clean your data.

    "text": "Cardiovascular Disease Mortality | Dataset\nThis dataset provided by the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services contains county-level estimates of hypertension-related cardiovascular disease (CVD) from 2000 to 2019, as well as two 10-year trends (2000-2010, 2010-2019), by age group, race/ethnicity, and sex. Each year and 10-year period contains 50,176 rows. About half of the values for “Data_Value” are na (empty), possibly because some demographics are not represented in state populations.\nWe may be more interested in looking at individual years, as 1. the total dataset amounts to over 1 million rows, and 2. the rows concerning 10-year trends are calculated through a Bayesian model and do not represent raw data."

    "section": "Household Pulse Survey | Dataset",
    "text": "Household Pulse Survey | Dataset\nThe Household Pulse Survey surveys households across the country on a variety of different measures of wellbeing including mental health, food access, and housing. This survey has been collected since 2020 and is collected using a two weeks on, two weeks off approach. This means that there are several data sets spanning the past four years. Looking at one survey period, there are 51281 rows and 163 columns.\nThe data is collected to get quick information on the social and economic wellbeing of households across the country. Looking at this data we could examine changes in mental health across different states and over the past four years. We could also look at different economic factors for example housing and food insecurity across time and regions. There are several potential challenges with this data set. First, since this survey is distributed so frequently, there are close to 60 data sets per year which may be difficult to sift through. Additionally, as the data looks at a wide range of factors it may be difficult to focus on one or two."

    "section": "Drug Overdose Death Rates | Dataset",
    "text": "Drug Overdose Death Rates | Dataset\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention documented drug overdose death rates based on drug type, sex, age, race, and Hispanic origin. The dataset dates from 1999 to 2018, with 6228 rows and 16 columns. The CDC has released datasets containing this information annually since 1999 and has data up to 2019, but isn’t publicly available on their website.\nWe are hoping to analyze the disparities in drug overdoses based on race from the 20 years of data collection. From the data, we could also determine which races have the highest access (potentially finding what race the majority of the youngest age, documented as “Under 15 years,” drug overdoses occur) to certain drugs e.g. heroin and natural and semisynthetic opioids, and the death rates associated with each drug. The time progression can show trends in access to drugs and deaths, although a possible challenge is that we might see rising numbers in deaths solely as a byproduct of the growing population. This might mean we need to standardize the data with respect to population count. Another concern is there are 11 values in the “STUB_LABEL” column, so we may need to group columns to visualize the effects of race on drug overdose better."

    "text": "This past week, we finalized our data set, the Household Pulse Survey, and have been focused on fine-tuning our data. We had an issue last week where our blog post wasn’t published, despite committing it to our main page, which we resolved during class. Because Professor Sussman wasn’t able to view our first blog post where we pitched our dataset, we ran it by him in class and he approved. We are also mindful that there are potential biases from this dataset and other research has shown how certain question orderings impact responses. Despite this, we are continuing to explore this dataset because it’s guided federal emergency responses during the peak of COVID-19, meaning it’s played a significant role in policy."

    "text": "Data for Equity\n\nBeneficence:\nOne of the principles for advancing equitable data practice is to “be transparent about the limits of the data”. This is relevant to our data because the data from the Household Pulse Survey is voluntary and self-reported, possibly leading to different interpretations for each question, especially ones regarding mental health. This principle entails adding disclaimers to the data analysis. Without transparency, the analysis could be misinterpreted and abused.\n\n\nJustice\nAnother principle is to “return data and research results to community members in a form they can use”. This is important so members who were surveyed for the Household Pulse Survey can benefit and learn from the data collection. We will do this for our data by presenting the analysis in an accessible and organized format on the group project website."

    "text": "These are the steps that you will take today to get started on your project. Today, you will just be brainstorming, and then next week, you’ll get started on the main aspects of the project.\n\nStart by introducing yourselves to each other. I also recommend creating a private channel on Microsoft Teams with all your team members. This will be a place that you can communicate and share ideas, code, problems, etc.\nDiscuss what aspects of the project each of you are more or less excited about. These include\n\nCollecting, cleaning, and munging data ,\nStatistical Modeling,\nVisualization,\nWriting about analyses, and\nManaging and reviewing team work.\n\nBased on this, discuss where you feel your strengths and weaknesses might be.\nNext, start brainstorming questions you hope to answer as part of this project. This question should in some way be addressing issues around racial disparities. The questions you come up with should be at the level of the question we started with when exploring the HMDA data. (“Are there differences in the ease of securing a loan based on the race of the applicant?”) You’ll revise your questions a lot over the course of the project. Come up with a few questions that your group might be interested in exploring.\nBased on these questions, start looking around for data that might help you analyze this. If you are looking at U.S. based data, data.gov is a good source and if you are looking internationally, I recommend checking out the World Bank. Also, try Googling for data. Include “data set” or “dataset” in your query. You might even include “CSV” or some other format. Using “data” by itself in your query often doesn’t work too well. Spend some time searching for data and try to come up with at least three possible data sets. (For your first blog post, you’ll write short proposals about each of them that I’ll give feedback on.)\nCome up with a team name. Next week, I’ll provide the Github Classroom assignment that will be where you work on your final project and you’ll have to have your team name finalized by then. Your project will be hosted online at the website with a URL like sussmanbu.github.io/ma4615-fa23-final-project-TEAMNAME.\n\nNext time, you’ll get your final project website set up and write your first blog post."
