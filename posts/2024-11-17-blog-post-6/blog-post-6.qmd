This week, we finished merging our two datasets. We had some initial issues because we had to make adjustments to our primary dataset by assigning new values to a column. The column “EST_ST,” representing the state that the participants live in, had values 1-50 to reflect each state. However, the dataset that we are merging (healthcare accessibility data) had the states written out to reflect where participants lived, so we had to convert values (Alabama = 1, Alaska = 2, …).  Once this was changed, we were able to merge the data and perform initial analyses. 

We completed a preliminary analysis of the merged data. This included creating a graph examining the relationship between number of psychiatrists in a state and the number of families reporting a child that needs mental health services. We also began the process of creating a map of the data using the census data. However, we have not finished the map.  


We spent the majority of this week fixing the errors in the merging of our data. Our goal for the coming week is to continue working on analyses of the combined data. Eventually, our plan is to create a series of maps to compare states.
