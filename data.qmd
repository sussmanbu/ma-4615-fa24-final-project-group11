## Overview of Household Pulse Survey Data

This data comes from a partnership between the Census Bureau, the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), and other federal agencies. The Household Pulse Survey is a 20-minute online survey published every two weeks, starting on April 23, 2020. The analyzed data set comes from the survey period between August 20 and September 16, 2024, and is available on the [Census Bureau website](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/household-pulse-survey/data/datasets.html).

#### Purpose and Design of the Survey

The survey was developed to provide timely and relevant data on the impact of COVID-19 in the United States. While multiple federal agencies contributed to the effort, the Census Bureau led the data collection. 

The Household Pulse Survey was specifically designed to collect data representing social and economic issues affecting American households. This data is critical for informing state and federal decisions, particularly during the peak of the pandemic when emergency response efforts were most urgent. Unlike other surveys tracking similar data, the Household Pulse Survey stands out for its frequent data collection and quicker turnaround.

#### Research and Insights

There have been various research efforts aimed to improve survey effectiveness and understand respondent behavior. For example:

- **Survey Response Strategies:** Renee Reeves and Kayla Varela conducted research to evaluate the Household Pulse Survey experiments. They analyzed strategies that increased response rates, focusing on contact methods such as text vs. email and URL length. Their findings include:
    - Text messages yielded higher response rates compared to emails.  
    - Shorter URLs containing "census.gov" were more effective than longer URLs.  
    - Sending texts exclusively, rather than a combination of texts and emails, generated the best responses.
    
- **Demographic Analysis:** Other research has explored demographics of respondents and nonrespondents, particularly those who selected non-definitive response categories. Studies also examined which demographics were more likely to answer questions related to sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI).

#### Potential Issues and Biases

The Household Pulse Survey has several limitations that could impact the data's accuracy and representativeness:

- **Voluntary and Self-Reported Date:** Responses are voluntary and self-reported, potentially leading to inconsistencies in how respondents interpret scales and questions, particularly on sensitive topics like mental health, where stigmas are present. Additionally, some respondents skip questions, which limits the data's completeness.

- **Non-Participation Bias:** While participants are randomly selected, those who choose not to participate may differ systematically from respondents. For example, nonparticipants may distrust the government or lack time to fill out the survey, which could correlate with survey variables.

- **Exclusion of Certain Populations:** The survey relies on household addresses, excluding individuals experiencing homelessness, which is an important demographic when considering the impact of COVID-19.

- **Changes in Question Design:** Survey questions have evolved over time, potentially impacting comparability. For instance, mental health questions initially asked about symptoms over a 7-day period but later shifted to a 14-day period in Phase 3.2. This change could lead to different responses, as a longer timeframe may capture more variation in experiences.  

## Data Files and Variables

The Household Pulse Survey dataset includes a broad range of variables, from veteran status to the impacts of natural disasters. To streamline the analysis and focus on specific areas of interest, we narrowed the scope to the following categories and variables. Variables with significant missing data, such as school type, were excluded.  

- **Basic Descriptive Variables**: Birth Year, Hispanic vs. Non-Hispanic, Race, Marital Status, Gender at Birth, Gender Identity, Sexuality, State, Household Income

- **Education and Employment**: Education Level, Employment Status, Job Loss, Kind of Work, Reason Not Working  

- **Active Duty and Veteran Status**: Active Duty, Veteran 

- **Mental Health**: Anxiousness, Worry, Interest (or lack thereof), Feeling Down, Children's Mental Health Treatment (Need for treatment, Receiving treatment, Difficulty obtaining treatment, Satisfaction with treatment), Social Support, Loneliness, Public vs. Private Health Care

### Overview of Area Health Resource Data
We also compared the Household Pulse Survey to the Area Health Resource Data for [2022-2023 at the State and National Level](https://data.hrsa.gov/data/download?hmpgtitle=hmpg-hrsa-data) from the Health Resources & Services Administration (HRSA). The Area Health Resources Files (AHRF) dataset has over 6,000 variables with current and historical data at county, state, and national levels, covering health care professions, facilities, population characteristics, economics, and more. It is designed for planners, policymakers, and researchers, and includes geographic codes for linking with other datasets and aggregating data by region.

We looked at the number of psychologists, social workers, counselors per state using this dataset.

## Second Data Set 
We also used health service information from the [Health Resources and Services Administration](https://data.hrsa.gov/data/download). This data shows the number of different health care providers across different states. As we are mainly focused on mental health, we decided to only use the columns that discussed the number of psychologists, social workers, and counselors per state. 

There a fewer worries of bias within this data as the numbers are not self reported. Additionally, professionals such as psychologists and social workers must be licensed in their state to practice, meaning the government has access to accurate numbers of professionals in each state. However, the simple numbers of professionals does not provide a full story of access to mental health care in a state. For example, there are questions about how many are private versus work for state institutions, what proportion work in crisis care and how many take different types of insurances. Therefore, these numbers are a good starting point to see access to care across different states, but can not give the full story.

## Page Info 

![](images/data-import-cheatsheet-thumbs.png)


Your [load_and_clean_data.R](/scripts/load_and_clean_data.R) file is how you will load and clean your data. Here is a an example of a very simple one.

```{r}
source(
  "scripts/load_and_clean_data.R",
  echo = TRUE # Use echo=FALSE or omit it to avoid code output  
)
```
You should never use absolute paths (eg. `/Users/danielsussman/path/to/project/` or `C:\MA415\\Final_Project\`).

You might consider using the `here` function from the [`here` package](https://here.r-lib.org/articles/here.html) to avoid path problems.

### Load and clean data script

The idea behind this file is that someone coming to your website could largely replicate your analyses after running this script on the original data sets to clean them.
This file might create a derivative data set that you then use for your subsequent analysis.
Note that you don't need to run this script from every post/page.
Instead, you can load in the results of this script, which could be plain text files or `.RData` files. In your data page you'll describe how these results were created. If you have a very large data set, you might save smaller data sets that you can use for exploration purposes.
To link to this file, you can use `[cleaning script](/scripts/load_and_clean_data.R)` wich appears as [cleaning script](/scripts/load_and_clean_data.R).
